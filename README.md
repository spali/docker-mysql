# Introduction
Dockerfile to build a MySQL container image which can be linked to other containers.

# Installation

Pull the latest version of the image from the docker index. This is the recommended method of installation as it is easier to update image in the future. These builds are performed by the **Docker Trusted Build** service.

```
docker pull spali/mysql:latest
```

Alternately you can build the image yourself.

```
git clone https://github.com/spali/docker-mysql.git
cd docker-mysql
docker build -t="$USER/mysql" .
```

# Quick Start
Run the mysql image

```
docker run --name mysql -d spali/mysql:latest
```

By default the root mysql user is not assigned a password and remote logins are permitted from the '172.17.%.%' address space. This means that you should be able to login to the mysql server as root from the host machine as well as other containers running on the same host.

To test if the mysql server is configured properly, try connecting to the server.

```
mysql -h$(docker inspect --format {{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}} mysql) -uroot
```

# Configuration

## Data Store
You should mount a volume at /var/lib/mysql.

```
mkdir -p /opt/mysql/data
docker run --name mysql -d \
  -v /opt/mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql spali/mysql:latest
```

This will make sure that the data stored in the database is not lost when the image is stopped and started again.

## Allowing remote access
By default the installation will allow remote access to the root user from the '172.17.%.%' address space. This means that your host machine and other containers running on the host machine can login to the mysql server as root.

```
GRANT ALL ON *.<db-name> TO '<db-user>'@'<ip-address>' IDENTIFIED BY 'PASSWORD' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

# Upgrading

To upgrade to newer releases, simply follow this 3 step upgrade procedure.

- **Step 1**: Stop the currently running image

```
docker stop mysql
```

- **Step 2**: Update the docker image.

```
docker pull spali/mysql:latest
```

- **Step 3**: Start the image

```
docker run --name mysql -d [OPTIONS] spali/mysql:latest
```
